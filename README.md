  # Note Taker

  ## Description

  This project is designed to interact with a server hosted on a local machine to save, write and delete notes on the server. This project's main purpose is to be a practice project for myself in regards to server-to-client interaction.

  ## Installation

  To install this project on your local machine, you will need to copy the clone url from the github repository. Once the url has been copied to your clipboard you will want to enter 'git clone (url here)' into your terminal. Ensure you have navigated to the proper file you wish to clone the repository in prior to executing the command. Once the file has been cloned, navigate into the source folder and execute the command 'npm i' to install all of the needed dependencies.

  ## Usage

  Once the project has been properly installed, you can then started the server from the terminal by executing the command 'node server.js' while located within the source folder. The server will then start on your local computer and you can now navigate to the url 'http://localhost:3000' to visit the project's home page. From here there is a button to take you to the notes page. The notes page displays all of the notes that are being stored on the server, including any that the user adds via the text boxes displayed on screen. Should the user wish to add a note, simply enter a title as well as some text and a save button will appear in the top right of the screen. Clicking this button will store the text in a note and the title will then show in the left column. The user can view their note again by simply clicking on their note's title. Should they wish to delete their note, it's as simple as clicking the trashcan icon located next to the note title.

  ## Credits

  This project was designed by DistantDig. Their Github profile can be found [here](https://github.com/DistantDig), and they can be reached via email at gmail.com. Much of the front-end related code was supplied via the staff of the edx coding bootcamp hosted through UC Berkeley. I am solely responsible for the code written within server.js, however I have touched little else of the project at time of writing.

  ## Contributing

  If you would like to contribute please feel free to fork the project, make improvements, and open a pull request on the source repo. I'm always happy to see other people's ideas and grow in my own skills through reverse engineering.

  ## Tests

  If you are interested in testing my project, please feel free to attempt to refine and optimize the code. I have not included any automatic testing files myself, but this does not mean I am opposed to them. Should anyone find any mistakes I have made (since I am human after all) please create an issue report for the sake of myself and anyone else who may use this application. Thank you in advance!
